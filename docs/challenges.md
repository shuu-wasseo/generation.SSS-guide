| 1         | reach 24^24 for the first time.                                                                             | inspired by antimatter dimensions' challenge 1. the player starts the game in this challenge. |
| 2         | S1 dimension is heavily weakened but gets an exponentially increasing bonus.                                | inspired by antimatter dimensions' challenge 3.                                               |
| 3         | buying a dimension automatically erases all lower tier dimensions.                                          | inspired by antimatter dimensions' challenge 4. autobuyers are locked in this challenge.      |
| 4         | S7 and S8 dimensions are unavailable.                                                                       | inspired by antimatter dimensions' challenge 10.                                              |
| 5         | all dimension costs change base from 2 to 3.                                                                | inspired by FE000000's challenge 10.                                                          |
| 6         | all dimensions get a random multiplier from x0.24 to 8.                                                     | inspired by antimatter dimensions' challenge 7.                                               |
| 7         | each dimension produces the dimension two tiers below. if not available, produces S.                        | inspired by antimatter dimensions' challenge 12.                                              |
| 8         | each dimension produces the nearest lower-tier dimension in the same subunit. if not available, produces S. | inspired by antimatter dimensions' challenge 12.                                              |
