# prestige 

prestige is one of the most important features of various incremental games, usually resetting a certain part of the game for a reward.

[[toc]]

## sacrifice

sacrifice requires 1 S8 S dimension that costs 1.845e19 (or 2<sup>64</sup>) S.

when you perform a sacrifice, all S1-S7 S dimensions are taken away, and a boost of `log<sub>8</sub>n` (where n is the amount of S on sacrifice) is provided to the S8 dimension.

## grand gravity

grand gravity requires 1.334e33 (or 24<sup>24</sup>) S.

grand gravity resets all S dimensions and gives the following rewards:

| reward                     | quantity                                              | condition                                                                                          |
| :------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| como                       | 2 ^ (number of grand gravities already performed + 1) | any                                                                                                |
| objekt with serial 100     | 1                                                     | number of objekts with serial 100 already obtained < 8                                             |
| objekt with serial 101-108 | 1                                                     | number of objekts already obtained < 72 and number of objekts with serial 100 already obtained = 8 |
