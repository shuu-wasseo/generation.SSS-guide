# welcome to generation.SSS!

generation.SSS is an incremental game based on polynomial growth. you can visit it [here](https://shuu-wasseo.github.io/generation.SSS/).

[[toc]]

## background

### incrementals

generation.SSS is heavily inspired by the likes of [antimatter dimensions](https://ivark.github.io/AntimatterDimensions/) and [FE000000](https://dan-simon.github.io/misc/fe000000/), where each generator generates the tier below it.

for more information on incremental games, check out [The Paper Pilot's guide to incrementals](https://www.thepaperpilot.org/guide-to-incrementals/).

### tripleS

[tripleS](http://triplescosmos.com/) is a South Korean girl group formed by [MODHAUS](https://www.mod-haus.com/). the group is currently being introduced to the public through a pre-debut project that began in May 2022, where each of the 24 members are revealed periodically.

each S, or member of the group, will be performing as a solo, as various subunits (DIMENSIONs), or as a team. each DIMENSIONâ€™s composition is determined through Gravity, or votes from fans.

MODHAUS has created a fan-participatory governance system using blockchain technology in order to bring fans into the decision-making process. fans are given the opportunity to participate and communicate with the group by deciding the DIMENSIONs and the content through photocards called objekts and a currency called COMO.

## game basics

### concept

the concept of this game was based on antimatter dimensions, a game where each dimension creates the previous dimension. i wanted to make a tripleS parody so here it is!

### generators

most generators usually produce the generator one tier below them (S3 generators produce S2 generators, etc.) but S1 generators produce S, a special kind of energy with supernatural properties. buying a generator also multiplies the generator's overall production by 25/24.

### multipliers

boosters boost the different generators' production, allowing them to produce more and more.
