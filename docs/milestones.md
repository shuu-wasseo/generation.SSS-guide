# milestones
milestones are perks that are unlocked by completing certain tasks in the game. each milestone has an unofficial serial number, consisting of the category, row and the associated member.

for example, a milestone with serial number "grand gravity 12" would be in the first row of the grand gravity category and associated with the S2 dimension.

each milestone achieved raises the production of its associated dimension to the power of 1.125.
